# About

**still** is a super-minimal static site generator designed for small personal blogs.  
It converts Markdown files into simple HTML pages using `cmark` and combines them with a header and footer to produce fast, portable, brutally minimal websites.

The goal of still is to make it **as easy as possible to publish a blog** — no frameworks, no JS pipelines, just Unix tools.
